                <br><h4><b class="txcolor">Cotton and Silk Sarees:-</b></h4>
                <p>The word saree is derived from Sanskrit ‘Sati’ which means 'strip of cloth  and śāḍī   in Prakrit, and which was used as Saree  in Hindi. In the history of Indian clothing the sari is traced back to the Indus Valley civilization, which flourished during 2800–1800 BC around the western part of the Indian subcontinent. The earliest known depiction of the sari in the Indian subcontinent is the statue of an Indus Valley priest wearing a drape.</p>
                <p>At Aavran, we produce cotton and silk Sarees. Saree are available with Bagh print or Maheshwari pattern. Sarees can be produced on designs provided by the client.  </p>
              
                <br><h4><b class="txcolor">Scarves:-</b></h4>
                <p>A scarf is a piece of fabric  worn around the neck, or near the head or around the waist for warmth, cleanliness, fashion or for religious reasons. They can come in a variety of different colours. At Aavran we make cotton scarves in deferent colours, styles and sizes. We also have scarves with bagh hand prints.  We also produce silk scarves.</p>
                
                <br><h4><b class="txcolor">Dupattas :-</b></h4>
                <p>The origin of the dupatta can be traced to the Mohejo-daro civilization of the Indus Basin. From here it spread across the Indian subcontinent, especially during the rule of the Mughal Empire.</p>
                <p>A dupatta is traditionally worn across both shoulders. However, the dupatta can also be worn like a cape around the entire torso. The material for the dupatta varies according to the suit: cotton, Georgette, silk, chiffon, and more. At Aavran we produce cotton and Silk Duppata in various colours and styles.</p>
